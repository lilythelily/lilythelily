- 🙋🏻 Hi, I'm Kaori from 🇯🇵Japan.
- ⛵️ I embarked on a 💻 Frontend dev journey, while working as a UI/UX/Graphic designer.
- 🥸 Best advices for learning to code I have received so far are:
- - Do not beat yourself up.
  - Be brave enough to suck at something new.
  - Keep taking notes even if you have no clue at all what you are writing.
